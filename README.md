# Virtual-Malware-Analysis-Lab

## Objective
My objective is to create a secure and controlled environment for testing and analyzing 
malware using virtual machines to identify and understand indicators of compromise.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet poins]

### Tools Used
[Bulet points]

## Steps
- I first establish a sandboxed environment using VirtualBox with Windows 10 and Kali Linux as 
  virtual machines (VMs) to test malware safely without impacting your production system.
- I properly configured both VMs to prevent malware from spreading to host machines or other network devices.
  This includes setting up internal networks, static IP addresses, and ensuring no external internet or LAN access.
- Set up network configurations for communication between VMs, ensuring proper rules and permissions for testing. 
- I created snapshots of VMs before running tests to allow easy restoration to a clean state should the malware
  crash my VM.
- I utilize tools such as Metasploit for payload creation, and configure HTTP servers or other methods for delivering
  malware to my windows 10 test machines.
  
- I executed and test malware within this controlled environment to observe its behavior and collect telemetry.
  This involves using tools like Sysmon and Splunk on Windows 10 to gather and analyze data.
- I collected telemetry data from Sysmon through Splunk to identify malicious behavior and develop detection
  rules to alert on similar activities in the future.
