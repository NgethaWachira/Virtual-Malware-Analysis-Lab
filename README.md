# Virtual-Malware-Analysis-Lab

## Objective
My objective is to create a secure and controlled environment for testing and analyzing 
malware using virtual machines to identify and understand indicators of compromise.

### Skills Learned
- I learnt how to create and configure Virtual Machines using VirtualBox in Windows 10 and Kali Linux VMs.
  The ability to segment networks to prevent the spread of malware to the host machine or other machines on the 
  network through static IP assignment within VirtualBox.
- I am now familiar with creating snapshots of virtual machines to create restore points, allowing for safe 
  experimentation and rollback if necessary.
- Basic understanding how to build custom malware using tools like msfvenom with specific payloads (e.g., Meterpreter 
  reverse TCP) and ability to execute it in a controlled environment.
- Continued experience in configuring Sysmon for Windows event logging and setting up Splunk to ingest and analyze 
  Sysmon data and i understand how to set up detections based on this data.
- Build up skills in using Windows Task Manager and command line tools like netstat to monitor active connections and 
  processes.
- Also the ability to search and analyze event codes and process relationships in Splunk to understand malware behavior.
- Gained knowledge of how to create alerts based on telemetry data to detect and respond to future instances of similar 
  activities.

## Steps
- I first establish a sandboxed environment using VirtualBox with Windows 10 and Kali Linux as 
  virtual machines (VMs) to test malware safely without impacting your production system.
- I properly configured both VMs to prevent malware from spreading to host machines or other network devices.
  This includes setting up internal networks, static IP addresses, and ensuring no external internet or LAN access.
- Set up network configurations for communication between VMs, ensuring proper rules and permissions for testing. 
- I created snapshots of VMs before running tests to allow easy restoration to a clean state should the malware
  crash my VM.
- I began by developing our malware by using the Meterpreter reverse shell as our payload.

- I utilize tools such as Metasploit for payload creation, and configure HTTP servers or other methods for delivering
  malware to my windows 10 test machines.

- I executed and test malware within this controlled environment to observe its behavior and collect telemetry. I changed the payload options such as lhost IP address

I went to our test environment in windows 10, disabled the antivirus, downloaded the executable using our kali Linux IP address and port. I run the program and used tools like Sysmon and Splunk to gather and analyze data.

- I collected telemetry data from Sysmon through Splunk to identify malicious behavior and develop detection
  rules to alert on similar activities in the future.
